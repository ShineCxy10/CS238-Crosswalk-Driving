# CS238CrosswalkDriving
CS238 Final Project: Safe Autonomous Driving Through a Crosswalk (Group project with Xi Yan and Siyun Li)

In this work, we explore the problem of safe driving through a crosswalk for autonomous vehicles. We introduce the Crosswalk Driving problem where the vehicle must drive to a destination while obeying safety constraints. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose two environments: Simple Crosswalk and Jaywalker Crosswalk. We solve the MDP with several model-free reinforcement learning approaches.
